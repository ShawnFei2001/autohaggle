# AutoHaggle

AutoHaggle is an AI-powered car pricing and negotiation platform that helps users predict fair prices, compare dealer quotes, and secure the best deals. It leverages historical data, regional market trends, and community-shared quotes to provide accurate price estimates and negotiation insights.

## How AutoHaggle Works

### 1. Create a New Deal with Dream Car Parameters
Users start by entering their **dream car details** such as **make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location**. Our system then utilizes **historical sales data, regional market trends, and dealer listings** to provide a **fair price estimate** for that specific vehicle.

### 2. Get AI-Powered Price Predictions
Our predictive model is based on a **hybrid approach** to ensure the most accurate results. We first **assign users to a cluster** with similar and relevant data points. Then, based on the data in this cluster, we identify and apply the **best-performing model** for that specific case, optimizing accuracy in price predictions.

- **Historical transaction data** to find price patterns.
- **Regional supply and demand trends** to adjust for location-based variations.
- **Current dealership pricing** to ensure up-to-date market insights.

### 3. Compare Dealer Quotes with Community-Shared Data
Once users receive a **quote from a dealer**, they can compare it with **similar quotes in the same region** using our **community-driven quote database**. This feature helps users understand whether their offer is fair or if they can negotiate a better deal.

### 4. Beat Dealer Quotes & Negotiate a Better Price
Our platform will provide **LLM-based negotiation strategies (TODO)** to help users **find leverage points** in their dealer quotes. These AI-powered suggestions will analyze **hidden fees, financing terms, and market trends** to guide users on how to **lower costs and maximize savings**.

### 5. Secure the Best Deal & Share Final Quote
After successfully purchasing their car, users can **share their final dealer quote** with the community. This strengthens our **machine learning models**, improves **pricing accuracy**, and helps others **make more informed decisions**. Every shared deal contributes to building a more transparent and fair **car-buying ecosystem**.

## Technology Stack
